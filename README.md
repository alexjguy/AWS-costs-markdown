# AWS-costs-markdown
A python script that will take the costs out of AWS APIs and output them nicely in Markdown.
For now it only supports getting data out of EC2 and VPC.

I have not set any cli like parameters, you have some variable in the begining of the script with a list for which sites to get the data.


To do:
Include S3, CloudWatch and others.
